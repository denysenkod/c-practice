- this directory contains the skeleton for question 3
  of the simple regex recursive matcher practice test

- Files include:

match.[ch]:	regex pattern matching (match.c is incomplete)
testmatch.c:	Unit test program for match module
searchstr.c:	main program that uses regex ADT, parsing and mtching
		to match a regex against a string
.cbuild:	Custom CB config file to compile the main programs
		and link each against match.o here, along with
		the (sample solution) regex.o and parseregex.o from the
		support library.

- we also depend on ../lib/*
