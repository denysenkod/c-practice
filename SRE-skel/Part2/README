- this directory contains the skeleton for question 2
  of the simple regex recursive matcher practice test

- Files include:

parseregex.[ch]:	Translate a regex string into an abstract regex
			(parseregex.c is incomplete)
testparseregex.c:	Unit test program for parseregex regex parsing.
.cbuild:		Custom CB config file to compile the unit test programs
			and link them against the (working) regex.o from the
			support library.

- we also depend on ../lib/* for regex.h and other header files, and a support
  library containing pre-compiled implementations of modules needed.  To remind
  yourself of the data types defined in regex.h (SimpleType, SimplePat, SPList,
  etc) look in ../lib (or in ../Part1).
